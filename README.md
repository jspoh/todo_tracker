<br>
Once items are marked as done or closed, they will no longer be retrieved if you refresh the page/restart your browser/restart your OS.
<br>
If you ever want to clear all data, you may clear it from your browser or simply open up your browser console and entering <br>
<br>
localStorage.clear()

Hope this app is able to help you out!
